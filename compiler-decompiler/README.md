# Compiler and Decompiler

Simple program that compiles and decompiles a given text;
## How to Use
- To decompile, you first must want to compile(obviously), to compile you must put a chosen text at ``input.txt`` file;
- After saving, just run ``ruby compiler.rb`` and it is your text is compiled and will be available at output.txt;
- To decompile just run ``ruby decompiler.rb``, and your decompiled text will be shown at the console;

Finally this is just a program to test a compiler and a decompiler logic;
